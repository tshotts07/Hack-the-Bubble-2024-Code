S.4361 - Border Act of 2024,"The bill expands Department of Homeland Security (DHS) authority to address the processing of non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) and provides supplemental appropriations for related purposes. Among other provisions, the bill provides DHS emergency authority to summarily remove or prohibit the entry of certain non-U.S. nationals within 100 miles of the southwest land border. DHS may exercise this authority if DHS encounters an average of 4,000 non-U.S. nationals within a seven-day period. If the number of encounters reach certain higher thresholds, DHS must exercise the emergency authority. This emergency border authority expires after three years and may be modified by the President under specified circumstances. The bill extends and establishes immigration pathways for Afghan citizens or nationals, including by (1) making certain individuals admitted or paroled to the United States eligible for conditional permanent resident status, and (2) expanding eligibility for special immigrant visas for certain individuals who were injured while supporting the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. The bill extends and establishes immigration pathways for Afghan citizens or nationals, including by (1) making certain individuals admitted or paroled to the United States eligible for conditional permanent resident status, and (2) expanding eligibility for special immigrant visas for certain individuals who were injured while supporting the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.

S.596 - Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2021,"This bill expands Medicare coverage of intensive behavioral therapy 
for obesity. Specifically, the bill allows coverage for therapy that is 
provided by (1) a physician who is not a primary care physician; or (2) 
other health care providers (e.g., physician assistants and nurse 
practitioners) and approved counseling programs, if provided upon a 
referral from, and in coordination with, a physician or primary care 
practitioner. Currently, such therapy is covered only if provided by a 
primary care practitioner.  The bill also allows coverage under 
Medicare's prescription drug benefit of drugs used for the treatment of 
obesity or for weight loss management for individuals who are 
overweight. "
H.R.82 — 118th Congress (2023-2024),"This bill repeals provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for
 individuals who receive other benefits, such as a pension from a state 
or local government.  The bill eliminates the government pension offset,
 which in various instances reduces Social Security benefits for 
spouses, widows, and widowers who also receive government pensions of 
their own.  The bill also eliminates the windfall elimination provision,
 which in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for 
individuals who also receive a pension or disability benefit from an 
employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes.  These changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2023."
H.R.5074 — 118th Congress (2023-2024),"This bill delays a change to the payment methodology under Medicare 
for oral drugs that are used to treat end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Under
 current regulations, beginning January 1, 2025, the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services will incorporate payments for oral-only
 ESRD drugs into the ESRD prospective payment system rather than issuing
 separate payments to ESRD facilities. The bill delays implementation of
 this policy until January 1, 2033, or until an approved intravenous 
drug is available, whichever is earlier."
H.R.2 — 118th Congress (2023-2024),"This bill makes various changes to immigration law, including by 
imposing limits on asylum eligibility and requiring employers to use an 
electronic system to verify the employment eligibility of new employees."
S.1323 — 118th Congress (2023-2024),"This bill provides protections for federally regulated financial 
institutions that serve state-sanctioned marijuana businesses. 
Currently, many financial institutions do not provide services to 
state-sanctioned marijuana businesses due to the federal classification 
of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance.  Under the 
bill, a federal banking regulator may not penalize a depository 
institution for providing banking services to a state-sanctioned 
marijuana business. For example, regulators may not terminate or limit 
the deposit or share insurance of a depository institution solely 
because the institution provides financial services to a 
state-sanctioned marijuana business. The bill also prohibits a 
federal banking regulator from requesting or ordering a depository 
institution to terminate a customer account unless (1) the regulator has
 determined that the depository institution is engaging in an unsafe or 
unsound practice or is violating a law or regulation, and (2) that 
determination is not based primarily on reputation risk.  Additionally,
 proceeds from a transaction involving activities of a state-sanctioned 
marijuana business are no longer considered proceeds from unlawful 
activity. (Financial institutions that handle proceeds from unlawful 
activity are subject to anti-money laundering laws. Violators of these 
laws are subject to fines and imprisonment.) Furthermore, a 
financial institution, insurer, or federal agency may not be held liable
 or subject to asset forfeiture under federal law for providing a loan, 
mortgage, or other financial service to a state-sanctioned marijuana 
business."
H.R.2670 — 118th Congress (2023-2024),"This bill authorizes FY2024 appropriations and sets forth policies for 
Department of Defense (DOD) programs and activities, military 
construction, the national security programs of the Department of Energy
 (DOE), and the Maritime Administration, as well as the Department of 
State and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It also authorizes 
appropriations for the Defense Nuclear Safety Board and the Naval 
Petroleum Reserves, and sets policy for several other agencies, 
including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The bill authorizes
 appropriations, but it does not provide budget authority, which is 
provided by appropriations legislation."
H.R.5376 — 117th Congress (2021-2022),"This bill provides funding, establishes programs, and otherwise modifies 
provisions relating to a broad array of areas, including education, 
labor, child care, health care, taxes, immigration, and the environment."
