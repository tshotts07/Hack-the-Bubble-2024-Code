This is the code that I wrote for the University of St. Andrews 2024 STACS Hackathon called Hack the Bubble.
The theme was democracy so I attempted to write a voting system using OOP with Java.
The purpose was to allow a user to choose to be an admin and add/remove candidates and issues or a citizen who could choose an issue/candidate to vote on/for.
